# Pawrents Place Application

### Final Team Project for Skill Distillery

### Team Members
- Braylin Pichardo (Developer, Database Administrator
- Kristen Tsuboi (Developer, RepoOwner)
- Kris Veseley (Developer)
- Tia Wright (Developer, Scrum Master)

## Overview
The purpose of the application is to demonstrate our ability to create a project that utilizes a SQL database, Java REST backend, and a front end built with Angular. This project includes non-authenticated and authenticated views of data, login authentication to access C.R.U.D. functionality, and a seperate privilege level that can perform C.R.U.D. on data a non-privileged user cannot.

## Description
Pawrents Place is an application for pet owners. This application shows their pets basic information, medial information, shot records, and discussion boards for communication amongs that owner and the PAWviders (providers) they choose such as vets, boarders, groomers, etc. The information is available to the PAWvider as well. No more asking for shot records and feeding information because Pawrents Place provides that data.
